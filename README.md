#Survey Australopithecus Afarensis
##### Developed By: Kenn Breece - Dongchul Lee - Chris Pachomski - Melissa Wimberly


##What and Why?
<p>This is our clone of the website Survey Monkey used for purposes of learning how to create web based applications using a Sinatra back-end and Javascript front-end which incorporates AJAX calls.

Currently, we are planning an MVP which predefines all answers to created survey questions to yes or no and returns a percent as a result, which is then logged as 1 submission of the survey, accessible by the survey creator.</p>
